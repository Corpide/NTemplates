This example shows how to use nested SCAN loops to produce parent-child reports.
It's very similar to the Product list with groupings example but uses 2 data tables
instead of 1.

It also uses IF statements to achieve conditional formating.

Here you'll also see how to use NTemplates with plain objects instead of DataTables.

The template and the resulting report can be found at ..\..\Templates\ProductList.rtf

Modify records in the grid or add new ones at will, then press the 'Print' button. The report will be open with the default RTF editor.
